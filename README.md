## Class Structure

### Game Class
- **Location:** Main game file
- **Inheritance:** Singleton
- **Purpose:** Central game manager that handles game updates, rendering, and user input events.

#### Key Components
- **Initialization:** Sets up display, FPS control, and loads background images and UI elements.
- **Core Game Objects:**
  - **Camera:** Controls game view perspective.
  - **Level:** Manages level generation and structure.
  - **Player:** Manages player actions.
  - **Bullet Group:** Tracks projectiles.
  - **Enemy Instances:** Represents hostile entities.
- **UI Elements:** Score display, game-over message, and restart instructions.

#### Major Methods
- `__init__(self) -> None`: Initializes the game state, display window, game objects, and UI elements.
- `close(self)`: Terminates the game.
- `reset(self)`: Resets the game state, including camera, level, player, and enemies.
- `_event_loop(self)`: Handles user input events like quit and restart.
- `_update_loop(self)`: Updates player, level, and camera positions, and calculates the score.
- `_render_loop(self, camera: Camera)`: Draws background, level, player, and UI elements.
- `run(self)`: Executes the main game loop.

### Enemy Class
- **Purpose:** Represents hostile entities that shoot at the player.

#### Key Properties
- `WIDTH`: 50 pixels - Standard width.
- `HEIGHT`: 15 pixels - Standard height.
- `SHOOT_INTERVAL`: 1000 milliseconds - Time between shots.
- `instances`: List of all active enemy instances.

#### Major Methods
- `__init__(self, parent: Sprite, color=config.GRAY) -> None`: Initializes enemy position and sets up shooting.
- `update(self, camera: Camera) -> None`: Updates enemy position, manages shooting, and checks for bullet collisions.
- `shoot(self) -> None`: Creates bullets and sets their trajectory.
- `draw(self, surface: pygame.Surface, camera: Camera) -> None`: Renders the enemy and its bullets.
- `kill(self) -> None`: Removes enemy and clears bullets.
- `reset(self) -> None`: Resets enemy to its initial state.

#### Collision Handling Methods
- `handle_bullet_collision(self, bullet: Bullet)`: Processes bullet collision events.
- `check_player_bullet_collision(self)`: Detects player bullet collisions.

### Player Class
- **Purpose:** Represents the player's character and handles movement, shooting, and collisions.

#### Key Properties
- `BUTTON_GPIO_PIN`: GPIO pin for firing bullets.
- `last_fire_time`: Tracks the last bullet shot.
- `fire_cooldown`: Delay between bullet shots.
- `bullets`: Group containing bullets fired by the player.
- `gyro_sensor`: MPU6050 sensor for gyroscope movement control.
- `gyro_threshold`: Tilt sensitivity threshold.
- `_jumpforce` and `_bonus_jumpforce`: Configured jump forces.

#### Major Methods
- `init_gyro_sensor(self, retries=3)`: Initializes gyroscope control.
- `read_gyro_input(self)`: Reads gyroscope data to set movement.
- `fire_bullet(self)`: Fires a bullet.
- `update(self, camera: Camera)`: Updates player position and checks for collisions.
- `jump(self, force=None)`: Initiates a jump.
- `collisions(self)`: Checks for collisions with platforms.
- `draw(self, surface: pygame.Surface, camera: Camera)`: Renders the player and bullets.

### Bullet Class
- **Purpose:** Represents projectiles fired by either the player or enemies.

#### Key Properties
- `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT`: Size of the bullet.

#### Major Methods
- `__init__(self, x: int, y: int, speed: int, color, is_player_bullet: bool)`: Initializes bullet properties.
- `update(self, camera: Camera)`: Updates bullet position and checks for screen bounds.
- `set_position(self, penguin_x: int, penguin_y: int)`: Sets bullet starting position.

### Camera Class
- **Purpose:** Manages the game viewport, following the player as they progress.

#### Key Properties
- `state`: Represents the cameraâ€™s position.
- `lerp`: Controls camera smoothing.
- `maxheight`: Controls the highest point reached by the player.

#### Major Methods
- `reset(self)`: Resets the camera position.
- `apply_rect(self, rect: Rect) -> Rect`: Applies the camera offset to a given rect.
- `apply(self, target: Sprite) -> Rect`: Offsets a target sprite based on camera position.
- `update(self, target: Rect)`: Follows the target (player).

### Sprite Class
- **Purpose:** Base class for any drawable object like the player, enemies, or bullets.

#### Key Properties
- `color`: Color of the sprite.
- `rect`: Position and dimensions of the sprite.

#### Major Method
- `draw(self, surface: Surface)`: Draws the sprite to the main screen surface.

### Singleton Class
- **Purpose:** Ensures only one instance exists for classes that inherit it, like Game and Camera.

#### Key Mechanism
- `__new__`: Overrides instance creation to control singleton behavior.

### Settings Class
